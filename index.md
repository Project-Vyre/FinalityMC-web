# Ancient Text

{: .highlight }
Need to update the text below. It's been over a year.

## Create 0.5.1 Support

| Name | Create 0.5.1b supported? |
| ---- | ------------------------ |
| Finality | 0.6.0b, in development. |
| Finality Tau | 0.4.0b, in development. |
| Finality Genesis | 0.1.1b, publicly available. |
| Finality Mote | Since 0.1.0b |

You might have a few questions like: What does the b stand for? It currently stands for Beta. Unfortunately, users will not be able to download Alpha builds without having to manually intervene on the CurseForge app or the website, so it will always have the Beta label for now.

Need help determining if you can play the modpacks? Here's something that might help.

| Intel Desktop CPUs | AMD Desktop CPUs |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| i7-9700 | AMD Ryzen 7 3700X |
| i7-9700K | AMD Ryzen 9 7900 |
| i7-9700F | AMD Ryzen 9 7900X |
| i7-9700T | AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D |

- Intel desktop CPUs with the letter K are overclockable and usually selectively picked for quality and performance.
- Intel desktop CPUs with the letter F have their integrated GPU disabled because it was either non-functional or unstable. Not selectively picked and usually lower quality.
- Intel desktop CPUs with the letter T are optimized for lower power consumption but perform worse than CPUs without a letter. This means an i7-9700 will always outperform an i7-9700T.

- For AMD, no letter means standard. 
- If it comes with an X, it is high performance. 
- If it has X3D, usually that means that it has AMD's new 3D V-cache with a dedicated memory buffer. In layman's terms this basically means *fast* performance in gaming and 3D applications.

Examples of mobile grade CPUs:
- Anything with the letter U at the end in human terms means Ultra Low Power Consumption.
- Anything with the letter H at the end means High Performance.

| Intel | AMD |
| ----- | --- |
| i7-7500U | Ryzen 7 7730U |
| i7-8850H | Ryzen 7 7745HX |
