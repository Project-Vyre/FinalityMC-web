This is where you will find some general advice on how to progress through the modpack.

I will write down more tips here as time goes on.
* Thanks to Mystical Agriculture, everything is significantly easier to acquire. Build and create to your heart's desire!
* Keep any black dye you have for use later... JEI will show you what Black Iron is used for.
* The endgame was made with the expectation that you have figured out how to fully automate everything with Create.
* Dungeons and other structures may be very rewarding! Exploration is recommended.
* Enigmatic Legacy is a double edged sword. Actually READ the tooltips.
