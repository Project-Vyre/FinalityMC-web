# Endgame Progression
There are multiple paths that you can take. You can check the recipes in JEI's search menu.

## For Finality Omnia on MC 1.18.2
* You can make ProjectE's Gem armor and Red Matter tool set.
* You can make Avaritia's Infinity armor set which provides permanent Night Vision and Speed on top of the god mode protection from the Creativerite set.
  * Avaritia's tools are also more powerful, but also more destructive. The pickaxe alone mines a 16x9x16 area alone when you Shift + Right click to change it into a hammer, so be careful while using it.
* You can make the Ultimerite set which then evolves into the Creativerite set.

## For Finality Tau on MC 1.19.2
* ProjectE's Gem armor and the two consolidated red matter items are your best friend.
* Afterwards you can work your way to Creativerite.

## For Finality Mote on MC 1.19.2
