# Version 0.5.5b (1.18.2)
Some fixes, additions and removals. I will also be taking the time to rewrite my recipes in KubeJS. Restylizing all the tips from the Tips mod might have to wait for now, but I have added more to the Patchouli guidebook for the modpack.


### Client 0.5.5b [Last updated 5.5.23 7:22 PM EST]
* The mod developers have fixed the issue on their end. ~~DO NOT UPDATE ARCHITECT'S PALETTE! Anything higher than `Architects-Palette-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar` will crash the modpack due to incompatibility with **Every Compat (Wood Good)**!~~
* DO NOT CLICK ANY POTION EFFECTS IN THE INVENTORY GUI! It will crash the game! It is not caused by me.
* This is embarrassing to mention, but I was half asleep while implementing Avaritia's recipes, but you should be able to fully progress through it now.
  * Forgot what I was typing here but I'll remember... hopefully?
* Made a custom texture for the Akashic Tome and Morph Tool.
* Customized Inventory HUD+ to now show what ring and charm the player may be wearing.
* Added FTB Quests documentation for the Akashic Tome, Morph Tool and the Tempad.
* Added a new chapter to FTB Quests to group Travel Anchors, Waystones and Storage Management into.
* Implemented modpack icon, fresh from the Blender Cycles rendering engine.
