{: .warning}
FTB Chunks is being replaced by xaero96's suite of mods due to its inability to share waypoints or make waypoints visible to the players in the same FTB Teams. This should have been a *basic* functionality from the mod. Please back up all your waypoints and note their exact X, Y and Z coordinates. It is not my fault if you update to this version without reading the changelog. This was made obvious while doing multiplayer playthroughs. JourneyMap will never be added due to being resource intensive.

# FTB Quests
* Corrected `The Andesite Age` description text to use Zinc Ore instead of Nickel Ore.

## Config changes
* Waystones will now reduce XP cost every 250 blocks instead of every 1000 blocks.
* Disabled the Teleport button on Xaero's Minimap.
* Disabled `Ice and Fire` Copper, Silver Ore generation. I am very sorry that I did not disable it as I was not aware of this being an option in the config for the mod.
