All Finality modpacks are released on CurseForge only as **All Rights Reserved** with the exception of music and artwork from other artists. There are also slightly retextured textures of mod assets to better fit the modpack. However, I still consider the custom retextures belonging to the respective mod authors. Please see the credits page to see credits.

This covers the following files / folders.
* All FTB Quests, their Rewards and arrangement in `\instance\config\ftbquests\quests`
* All custom KubeJS **assets such as images, textures, blocks, block models, recipes** in `\instance\kubejs\`
  * There is a reason why I don't like sharing my work online, and that is plagiarism and previous negative experiences. **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN.**
* All custom Finality FancyMenu assets in `\instance\resources` and `\instance\config\fancymenu\`
  * This also applies to customizations made with DrippyLoadingScreen and FancyMenu.
  * The ARR license does not apply to the music in the `fancymenu\menu_music` folder. The music is owned by Cjbeards, Farabi Hasan Music and R3 Music Box.
  * **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN.**
* All customizations in `instance\resourcepacks\Finality Customizations\assets`
  * The custom menu music I have implemented in `Finality Customizations\assets\sounds\music\menu` and `\sounds\records` is NOT ours, however. The terms for Cjbeards's work can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZTM7nf4Uia19c-NQheqPnLAk1Bs6NS6XZiLt7Mk4Z1Q/edit#gid=0
  * As for Harabi Hasan's Music: *Feel free to use my mix as a BGM for your contents, but do please leave credits! HOWEVER, a repost of my mix (except if you leave my channel link and credit me) and/or extending it is prohibited.* https://youtu.be/1Jj5aAEYSeo
  * Custom retextures are a work in progress, but they are still considered ours and by extension, the authors of the original texture assets. **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN, AND BY EXTENSION THE ORIGINAL MOD ARTISTS AND THE ORIGINAL TEXTURE ARTISTS. DO NOT CLAIM OUR WORK AS YOUR OWN.**
