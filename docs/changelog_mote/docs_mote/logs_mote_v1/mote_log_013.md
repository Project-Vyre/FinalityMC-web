# Version 0.1.3b

7.11.23
This is not a game breaking update, so everything should work as usual. However, Cataclysm was recently updated earlier today (10:56 AM EST) which adds the new boss that I've been very excited about.

Also I forgot to remove an Extended Crafting singularity that used Ars Nouveau's Source Gem blocks which would result in an unnecessary error, apologies.

- Added new quests to suit Cataclysm's new update.
- Apparently the quest requirement for The Harbinger got changed to look at block instead of an entity, soooo that's fixed.

## Mod additions
- Added ModernFix to delete load time.
- Added FerriteCore (why did I not add this earlier?)
- Added LazyDFU (why did I also not add this earlier?)
- Added Loot Journal
