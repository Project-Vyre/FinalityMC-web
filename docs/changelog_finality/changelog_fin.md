{: .warning }
This modpack is actively in development and updates may be published every few days, always maintain backups of your builds with Create's Schematic and Quill item in-game if possible.

{: .important}
The modpack is technically complete in terms of progression, but not everything has been polished in FTB Quests and the Tome of Finality guidebook. This modpack is intended to try and teach players Create while having Terraria-esque items. Inspiration also came from shapez.io and Factorio in particular.

Currently the latest publicly accessible version is `0.5.8b`.
Soon to be released and published is `0.5.9b`.
Version `0.6.0b` is postponed due to KubeJS Create not having compatibility with Create 0.5.1. DO NOT UPDATE CREATE!

Below is the table of contents for the entirety of Finality's changelog for historical purposes by major numerical iteration. If you wish to see the each minor numerical iteration, then use the navigation sidebar on the left side.
