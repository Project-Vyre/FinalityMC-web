## v0.3.9.1b Changelog

**Downgraded Flat Colored Blocks to fix the invalid recipe serializer error on multiplayer servers. A server pack can now be released.**

# v0.3.9b Changelog
**Major changes. It is recommended to re-generate your world seed.**

{: .warning}
FTB Chunks is being replaced by xaero96's suite of mods due to its inability to share waypoints or make waypoints visible to the players in the same FTB Teams. This should have been a *basic* functionality from the mod. Please back up all your waypoints and note their exact X, Y and Z coordinates. It is not my fault if you update to this version without reading the changelog. This was made obvious while doing multiplayer playthroughs. JourneyMap will never be added due to being resource intensive.

{: .warning}
Do NOT update Some Assembly Required. It will require Create 0.5.1a and all modpack development tools are currently still behind. Please wait for the developers of KubeJS and KubeJS Create to add support for Create 0.5.1a! Quark currently also has issues with Create 0.5.1a.

# Cataclysm
~~Fixed L_Ender's broken English with lang files in the modpack resourcepack, you're welcome.~~
Edit: I quickly found out that you can't add more lines to the existing tooltip. Back to KubeJS tooltip modification.

# FTB Quests
Fixed the Cataclysm and Enigmatic Legacy related chapters and their quests.

# Tome of Finality (patchouli guidebook)
Updated entries to be on par with the 1.18.2 variant where FTB Chunks was removed.
