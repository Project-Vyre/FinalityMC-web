# Version 0.5.4b (1.18.2)
This is not exactly a minor patch as some major modifications were finally achieved for removing Avaritia's default recipes and updating the Tome of Finality.

### Client 0.5.4b
* FancyMenu and DrippyLoading screen updated.
* Applied customizations to tooltips. Please let me know if it looks bad!
* Updated Patchouli book, again.
* Updated some FTB Quest entries, also added the Tome of Finality and FTB Quest book to Emergency Items, just in case.
* Finally managed to remove and disable Avaritia's default recipes with the help of both CraftTweaker and KubeJS. Please use ExtendedCrafting and Create for progression into Avaritia.
* KubeJS has been added.
* DO NOT UPDATE ARCHITECT'S PALETTE! Anything higher than `Architects-Palette-1.18.2-1.2.0.jar` will crash the modpack!
* Creatified the vanilla compass recipe and disabled the quartz_clock recipe for the vanilla clock, will re-add at some point.

### Server 0.5.4se_b
* Synchronized Patchouli
* Added KubeJS with removal scripts.
