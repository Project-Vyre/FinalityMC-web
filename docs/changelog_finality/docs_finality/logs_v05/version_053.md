# Version 0.5.3b (1.18.2)
This version of the modpack is not going to be accessible on CF as the modpack and server pack were not uploaded correctly and resulted in file hash conflicts despite additional changes.

### Client 0.5.3b
* Fixed Auudio loading music files in loading world screen, music should only play on the main menu now.
* Fixed ESSENTIAL conflicting with Simple Discord Rich Presence.
* 0.5.3b Re-released again because I forgot to change a config file for FancyMenu

### Server 0.5.3se_b
* Changed Better Compatibility Checker version to 0.5.3b
