# Version 0.1.4b

Not a world or game breaking update, so it is safe to update.

## Config and core updates

- Apparently the Alex's Mobs compat datapack for IDAS was implemented, this has now been removed.
- Added additional descriptions to Create related quests.
- Fixed structure detection to detect YUNG's Better Nether Fortress instead of the vanilla Nether Fortress.

These changes will be applied to all versions of Finality.
- Moved Jade to the top left corner to provide unobstructed viewing of Cataclysm's boss health bars.
- Enigmatic Legacy's Amulet Vessel now can only be claimed by the original owner.
- Reduced Tempad's cooldown to 30 seconds.
- Added Nicer Rain by Lat
- Increased inventory space for Backpacked's backpacks please update your server's config files if it does not synchronize over!
  - Added a recipe that uses Leather to make the item more accessible. Bunnies don't seem to spawn all that often.

These changes will be applied to all versions of Finality on Forge MC 1.19.2 and higher.
- Fixed JEI information script.

## Mod additions
- Added Carry On
  - Blacklisted EnderChests and EnderTanks to prevent the visual bug (private EnderChests and EnderTanks with their diamond trims being removed after being carried)from ocurring.
- Added Clumps
  - This should have been here from the start, but this was my Just Create (Forge) instance so I just never added it after converting it to a modpack.
- Re-added Healing Campfire
  - I was very hesitant in adding this ONLY out of the concern of adding more mods, but it has been re-added.
- Added Toast Control 
  - Just to silence certain annoying Toasts along with making them translucent as to not obstruct certain UI elements.
