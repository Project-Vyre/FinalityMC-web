# Finality Tau 0.4.0b Changelog

Game Breaking
{: .label .label-red }

In Development
{: .label .label-yellow }

Do not update `Flat Colored Blocks - For Forge` as the newest version still breaks server joining.
{: .warning }

Updated to `Forge 43.2.14` from `Forge 43.2.11`.

Currently there is a mod that keeps saying "This block has functions that are not fully implemented. Stay Tuned!" and I don't know which mod it is. The good thing is that this message only appears on reload or world join then disappears shortly afterward.

- Essential should now zoom in smoothly by default.
- Fixed ProjectE's Philosopher's Stone being uncraftable with NULL singularities.
- Fixed Quark configs which nerfs were all enabled by default for whatever reason.
  - Iron Golem's should still drop iron ingots.
  - Mending has been restored to full functionality.
- Some other Quark tweaks:
  - Disabled Quark's Backpack
  - Disabed Totem of Holding as it is now overriding Enigmatic Legacy's Enigmatic Charm
  - Disabled Matrix Enchanting
  - Disabled Pipes
- Fixed Cataclysm config. The times below are in seconds.
  - Bulwark of the Flame Cooldown: 60
  - Gauntlet of Bulwark: 60
  - Infernal Forge: 30
  - The Incinerator: 60
  - VASW Cooldown: 60
  - Void Core Cooldown: 60
  - Void Forge Cooldown: 60
  - WASW Howitzer Cooldown: 60
  - WASW Missile Cooldown: 30
- Added changes to Savage Ender Dragon fight
  - You'll need some protection, maybe.
