Finality is released on CurseForge only as **All Rights Reserved** with the exception of KubeJS scripts.
This covers the following files / folders.
* All FTB Quests, their Rewards and arrangement in `\instance\config\ftbquests\quests`
* All custom KubeJS **assets such as images, textures, blocks, block models, recipes** in `\instance\kubejs\`
  * Scripts are under the **MIT license**, but remove `Finality` from the Recipe IDs when you are using them for your purposes.
  * There is a reason why I don't like sharing my work online, and that is plagiarism and previous negative experiences. **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN.**
* All custom Finality FancyMenu assets in `\instance\resources` and `\instance\config\fancymenu\`
  * This also applies to customizations made with DrippyLoadingScreen and FancyMenu.
  * **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN.**
* All customizations in `instance\resourcepacks\Finality Customizations\assets`
  * The custom menu music I have implemented in `Finality Customizations\assets\sounds\music\menu` is NOT ours, however. The terms for Cjbeards's work can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZTM7nf4Uia19c-NQheqPnLAk1Bs6NS6XZiLt7Mk4Z1Q/edit#gid=0
  * Custom retextures are a work in progress, but they are still considered ours and by extension, the authors of the original texture assets. **DO NOT CLAIM MY ARTWORK AS YOUR OWN, AND BY EXTENSION THE ORIGINAL MOD ARTISTS AND THE ORIGINAL TEXTURE ARTISTS. DO NOT CLAIM OUR WORK AS YOUR OWN.**
