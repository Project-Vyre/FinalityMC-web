This is where you will find advice that is more specific on how to progress through the modpack.

Below is an index table directly imported from the Tome of Finality patchouli guidebook in-game, but it's hosted on the website so it's easier to format and organize without the space limitations of a book.

Not all of the categories have been implemented in-game as I am still trying to think of what to put in it and how to organize the information. Thank you for your patience. - CelestialAbyss

I will write down more tips here as time goes on.
* Thanks to Mystical Agriculture, everything is significantly easier to acquire. Build and create to your heart's desire!
* Keep any black dye you have for use later... JEI will show you what Black Iron is used for.
* The endgame was made with the expectation that you have figured out how to fully automate everything with Create.
* Dungeons and other structures may be very rewarding! Exploration is recommended.
* Enigmatic Legacy is a double edged sword. Actually READ the tooltips.
