This is where you will find some general advice on how to progress through the modpack.

I will write down more tips here as time goes on.

# For beginners...
* JEI is your friend when it comes to finding recipes that don't fit inside the Tome of Finality guide book, which is currently not finished.
* Gather lots of iron, andesite and kelp, your future self will thank you once you get into Create.
* Create's Ponder tutorial system is your best friend.

# General Tips
* Thanks to Mystical Agriculture, everything is significantly easier to acquire. Build and create to your heart's desire!
* Keep any black dye you have for use later... JEI will show you what Black Iron is used for.
* The endgame was made with the expectation that you have figured out how to fully automate everything with Create.
* Dungeons and other structures may be very rewarding! Exploration is recommended.
* Enigmatic Legacy is a double edged sword. Actually READ the tooltips.

## Artifacts
I won't try to spoil anything regarding artifacts, but carefully read their names and their tooltips. 
* There is a certain necklace upon wearing it causes you to sink but also walk freely in water. **Be careful.**
* Not all artifacts are 100% beneficial, some will cost you either temporarily or permanently.
