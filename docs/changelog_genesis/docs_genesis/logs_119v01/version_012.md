# Genesis 0.1.2b

{: .warning }
Create Confectionery has been removed.

## 7.27.23
Singularity recipe changes have been implemented for the most part, but I'm still double checking everything.
Implemented Infusion Crystals reworked recipe to avoid the disappearing output result bug.

- Tempad now takes 30 seconds to recharge, a change carried over from the Mote variant of Finality.
- Backpacked's Backpack now has 7 rows, a change carried over from the Mote variant of Finality.

## 7.26.23
Hi, it's been a while since I updated this modpack. MANY updates have been made, but there have been no world breaking changes.

Where it will hurt most is the amount of changed recipes from the other variants of Finality, so you will definitely need to rework some sequenced assembly lines.
