# Version 0.1.1b

Iteration 1, minor update 1.

- Fixed modpack resourcepack not loaded by default, shipping options.txt with this update in case DefaultConfigs does not do its job or I forgot to save settings, again...
- Added "You can also now repair your tools in the crafting grid, so you won't have to throw away your items." to the `Useful Utilities` quest in FTB Quests.
- Corrected `I don't remember Sugar Cane growing that tall...` rewards to compensate for the absence of Croptopia.
- Changed Ad Astra's Nasa Workbench recipe to require mechanical crafting along with progression with ExtendedCrafting.
- Tome of Finality now loads correctly.
- Corrected Handheld crafting table recipe as variant crafting tables is no longer installed. Instead it has been replaced by blue skies compat just in case you need it.
- Added the Terrible Sword to a quest in the Aquamirae chapter as a requirement. (thank you SuperHeroPuppy from the Create Discord server for pointing this out)
