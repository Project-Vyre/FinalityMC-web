# Version 0.6.0b (Create 0.5.1b)

In Development
{: .label .label-yellow }


KubeJS Create has been updated to have compatibility with Create 0.5.1b.

This changelog has been written after I wrote the changelog for Finality Tau, so this is going to be a lot of repeated lines.

Dimensional Dungeons has been updated with new rooms, so you may have to re-generate your dungeons.

## Finality Core changes
- Added tight Create integration for Tinker's Construct.
- Changed Wither Storm related recipes to use Insanium Essence, not just corruption.
  - This should have been the original recipe.
- Revised singularity crafting.
  - Now requires dormant singularity cores to start the process.
